# Exploratory-Analysis-of-Global-Earthquake

📌 Project Overview

-This project analyzes global earthquake data to understand patterns in magnitude, depth, frequency, and regional seismic activity.

-The analysis explores how earthquakes are distributed across continents and fault zones, and highlights major earthquake trends over time.

-The project includes visualizations and insights derived from exploratory data analysis (EDA).

🎯 Objective

-To study global earthquake patterns using statistical and visual analysis.

-To identify regions with high seismic activity and frequent earthquakes.

-To analyze the relationship between earthquake magnitude, depth, and geographic location.

-To create meaningful visualizations that help interpret global seismic risk.

📊 Key Features of the Analysis

-Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, converting time formats, and preparing coordinates.

-Magnitude Distribution: Examining the frequency of earthquakes across different magnitude scales (minor, moderate, strong, major).

-Depth Analysis: Identifying shallow vs deep earthquakes and their regional patterns.

-Geographical Mapping: Plotting earthquakes on world maps to visualize hotspot regions (e.g., Pacific Ring of Fire).

-Time-Series Trends: Analyzing earthquakes by year, month, and decade to identify long-term patterns.

-Correlation Study: Exploring connections between magnitude, depth, and location.

-Outlier Detection: Identifying unusually strong or deep earthquakes.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

-Python – Pandas, NumPy

-Visualization Libraries – Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn

-Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step EDA

-Geospatial Tools – Folium / Plotly Mapbox (if used)

-Dataset: Global earthquake records (e.g., USGS Earthquake Catalog)
